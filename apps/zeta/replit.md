# Fantasma Firewall - Security Operations Center

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React, TypeScript, Express, and Drizzle ORM that provides a security operations center (SOC) dashboard for the ZEBULON Web3 Interface. The application features real-time threat monitoring, AI-powered security analysis, and comprehensive protection systems including multi-layer encryption. All components (ZWAP exchange, Zeta Core AI, and Zinc infrastructure) are arms of the unified ZEBULON Web3 Interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Mobile-first design with minimal sections and dropdown navigation in header.
Clean logo display without filters or modifications - logos should appear naturally as designed.
Simplified layouts - user prefers minimal design with less visual complexity. Keep original blue color scheme.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the UI layer
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom dark theme for styling
- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Socket.IO Client** for real-time updates
- **shadcn/ui** component library with Radix UI primitives

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **Socket.IO** for real-time WebSocket communication
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL for database operations
- **Neon Database** as the PostgreSQL provider
- **DatabaseStorage** implementation for persistent security data

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Security Events**: Real-time threat detection logs
- **Threat Patterns**: AI pattern recognition signatures
- **System Metrics**: Performance and health monitoring
- **ZWAP Protection**: Smart contract and exchange security
- **Encryption Layers**: Quantum encryption status
- **Network Nodes**: Distributed security topology

## Key Components

### AI Security Core
- **Zeta Core AI**: Main AI engine for threat analysis
- Continuous pattern analysis and confidence scoring
- Neural processing metrics and threat prediction
- Real-time scanning and automated responses

### Security Monitoring
- **Firewall Service**: Threat detection and blocking
- **Corporate Sabotage Detection**: Advanced threat pattern recognition
- **Market Manipulation Monitoring**: Trading anomaly detection
- **Real-time Event Logging**: Comprehensive security audit trail

### Protection Systems
- **Quantum Encryption**: Multi-layer security protection
- **ZWAP! Exchange Protection**: Smart contract security monitoring
- **Network Topology Management**: Distributed node security
- **Community Protection**: User privacy and anti-censorship

### Real-time Dashboard
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Clean, streamlined layout for mobile devices
- **Header Navigation**: Three dropdown menus (Integrations, Security, Actions)
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live security updates every 5 seconds
- **Interactive Components**: Modular dashboard widgets with collapsible sections
- **Status Monitoring**: System health and performance metrics
- **Alert System**: Priority-based threat notifications

## Data Flow

1. **Security Events**: Generated by various monitoring services
2. **AI Analysis**: Zeta Core processes events for threat patterns
3. **Database Storage**: Events and metrics stored via Drizzle ORM
4. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO broadcasts to dashboard clients
5. **UI Rendering**: React components display live security status

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR support
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom theme
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundling for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Vite Dev Server**: Frontend with hot module replacement
- **Express Server**: Backend API with automatic restart
- **In-memory Storage**: Local development without database setup
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time features in development mode

### Production Build
- **Vite Build**: Optimized frontend bundle in `dist/public`
- **ESBuild**: Server bundle in `dist/index.js`
- **Database Migrations**: Automated schema deployment via Drizzle
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL and configuration
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent storage for all security data

### Architecture Decisions

**Problem**: Real-time security monitoring dashboard
**Solution**: Socket.IO for live updates with fallback polling
**Rationale**: Provides immediate threat visibility with reliable connection handling

**Problem**: Type-safe database operations
**Solution**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schema definitions
**Rationale**: Ensures data consistency and developer productivity

**Problem**: Scalable component architecture
**Solution**: shadcn/ui with Radix primitives and Tailwind styling
**Rationale**: Accessible, customizable components with consistent design system

**Problem**: Development experience optimization
**Solution**: Vite + TypeScript + Hot reload across full stack
**Rationale**: Fast iteration cycles for complex security dashboard features

### Recent Changes (July 2025)

**Configuration-Based Integration System (July 21, 2025)**
- Converted all dashboard integrations from hardcoded functionality to configuration-based approach
- Separated Native Integrations (ZEBULON ecosystem) from External Integrations (third-party platforms)
- Added comprehensive How-To guides for external integrations:
  * Third-Party Security Platforms (SIEM, Threat Intelligence, Incident Response)
  * Cloud Platform Integration (AWS, Azure, GCP, Multi-Cloud)
  * Custom API Integration Builder (RESTful APIs, Webhooks, Message Queues)
  * Zapier Automation Workflows
- All integration buttons direct users to detailed setup instructions rather than hardcoded features
